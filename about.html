				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Tiffany Liu. I was born in Taiwan, but I have also spent time living and studying in China and the United States before entering Carnegie Mellon University. I am now a Junior Business Administration and Human-Computer Interaction double major at Carnegie Mellon University. On campus, I am also involved as a designer for TEDxCMU, a blogger for the Business School's Life@Tepper blog, and a member of Kappa Phi Lambda.</p>
				<p>My passion lies in creating. In the past, I have experimented with all forms of arts and craft, from painting to sketching to photography to scrapbooking to fashion to bookbinding - you name it, I've probably tried it. Today, I mostly stick to bullet journaling and design as creative outlets, but I am always on the lookout for my next creative exploration.</p>
				<p>Based on my studies and passions, I am interested in exploring the intersection between business, technology, and the creative and how it fits in our world today.</p>
